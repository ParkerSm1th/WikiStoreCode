**How do we organize and keep track of stars in the sky?**
_No lights you could see ~3000 stars_

- You can use constellations to identify where things in the sky are
  - 88 constellations are officially defined by the IAU.
  - Orion contains:
    - Betelgeuse & M42
  - Things can be within a boundry of a constellation without being part of a constellation
  - Objects in constellations are not close or related at all, they can all be super far or close because we look at a 2d sky of a 3d space
  - 4 of 88 constellations
    - 2 stick figures are gemini
    - Leo looks like a lion
    - Ursa major, supposed to look like a bear
    - Torres looks like a bull
  - 50 ancient constellations
    - Ptolemy (2nd century) recorded 48 in his **Almagest** (the greatest compelation)
    - Argo Navis: Carina, Puppis, Vela
  - 38 modern constellations
    - Used objects instead of animals
    - Fornax, microscopium, telescopium, Recorded in 16th - 18th centuries

#### Constellations vs. Asterisms

**Difference**

- Asterisms can be pieces of a bigger constellation
- Constellations are official pieces of the sky whereas asterisms are just smaller pieces
- Main difference: Asterism is any pattern of stars that you can recognize, a constellation is an official patch of sky tha thas a asterism in it but is an official puzzle piece

**Naming Stars and Deep Sky Objects**

- Betelguese and Rigel are also known as Alpha and Beta orionis
- M13 is a globular star cluster.
- 110 deep sky objects have a Messier number
- No proper named stars can be refered to as Alpha Orionis, Beta Orionis and so on based on brightness level
- HD(Number) means something has been seen before

**Local Reference Points**

- Horizion is where the sky meets the ground
- Meridian is a line that connects north pole to zenith, to south pole
  - For sun homework turn on meridian line and measure when sun is on it
- Zenith is straight up
- Azimuth: N = 0, E = 90, S = 180, W = 270
- Altitude: 0 - 90 (zenith)
- Angular distances are measured in degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds.
  - 60degrees 35' 18" = 60 + 35/60 + 18/3600 = 60.5883
  - 60' in 1 degree
- The Sun and Moon take up 0.5degree of the sky

\*\*The Celestial Sphere

- The ecliptic is tilted 23.5degrees with respect to the celestial equator.
  - #definition Celestial sphere, all stars on on 1 fixed sphere
  - #definition Celestial equator is the earths equator up on the sky
  - #definition The ecliptic is the line the sun is stuck on over the course of a year but solar system is flat so the solar system takes up a line on the sky, ecliptic and equator are tilted by 23 degrees
- The sky rotates around the celestial poles
  - #definition Celestial poles are the 2 ends of the sphere
- The zodiac extends 8° north and south of the ecliptic
  - #definition Zodiac is each piece of 12 broken up sky, but the Zodiac has 13. The sun is either in cancer or close to cancer the day that you were born
- The global coordinate system
  - #definition Latitude: degrees north or south of the equator
  - #definition Longitude: degrees east or west of the prime meridian
  - #definition Prime meridian is going straight through the observatory in London.
  - #definition Nadir the point on the celestial sphere directly below an observer
- Equatorial coordinates on the Celestial Sphere
  - #definition Equatorial is longitude and latitude in the sky
  - Right ascension = celestial longitude.
  - Decliniation = celestial latitude
  - Ecliptic is 23.5° from celestial equator
- Why do stars rise and set?
  - Which direction does the sky move?
  - What is at this spot in the sky?
- Make change in homework in sky movement direction
- Circumpolar stars never set
- Polaris is the North Star
  - Used for navigation
  - Find with the pointer stars in the Big Dipper
  - Polaris Altitude = Northern Latitude
- Procession of Earth's Axis
  - Now: Polaris
  - The north star changes on a 26,000-year cycle.
  - #definition Precession is the "wobble" throughout earths axis
  - This is why the north star changes
- Determining length of day
  - Egyptians split the day into 24 hours.
    - Before noon: ante meridiem
    - After noon: post meridiem
  - You can roughly tell the time by how shadows
- Equation of time?
  - The figure eight is called an analemma
  - Sun moves faster or slower than clock
  - Term solstice is based on the analemma

#### Local vs. Global Coordinates

#### Sidereal vs. Solar Day

#### In class questions

1. How far does the sun travel across the sky in one hour?
   1. 15 degrees in 1 hour, 360 / 24
2. While observing from Colorado with friend in Hawaii
   1. Equatorial

**Sidereal vs Solar Day**

- Sidereal Day: 23hrs 56mins
- Solar day is the 24hrs because it takes around 4 minutes for the earth to rotate back to facing the sun
- A year corresponds to Earth's orital period.
  - We can track its progression via constellations.
- Things we can't see during winter are visible when the sun is up so we can't see them
- Sirius us the brightest star in the night sky (only visible in Winter)
  - (Sun is the brightest star in the sky)
- We can track a year by the seasons
  - Hypothesis: Earth-Sun distance causes seasons. False!
    - Makes sense, earth **is** closer to the sun at certain times of the year
    - Aphelion: July 4
      - Farthest away from the sun in our summer
    - Perihelion: January 4
      - Closest to the sun in our winter
  - Earth's obliquity (23.5°) causes seasons
    - #definition Obliquity means tilt!!!
    - The tilt is if you are tilted towards or away from the sun
    - Seasons is from more or less direct or indirect sunlight
    - When stuff is spread out it is the same amount of energy but it isn't as strong in 1 spot
  - The sun affects seasons in two ways
    - Summer solstice (first day of summer), highest point in the sky
    - Winter solstice (first day of winter), lowest point in the sky, shorter days in the winter
  - Seasons in the tropics: rainy vs dry
    - Tropic of Cancer (23.5)
    - Tropic of Capricorn (-23.5)
    - Anywhere between these has 2 seasons essentially, wet or dry
    - The sun can reach zenith in the tropics (Equinoxs)
    - The sun is still super high in the sky if you live in the tropics
  - Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle (23 degrees from poles)
    - Some days in the year when the sun is always up or the sun is always down
    - (24hrs of day light or darkness)
    - Polar regions have 2 seasons essentially, day or night
    - Sun can be circumpolar!!!
    - Even in summer the sun is really low on the sky

**Weeks**

- Modern says these 8 objects are planets
  - Mercury
  - Venus
  - Uranus
  - Earth
  - Mars
  - Jupiter
  - Saturn
  - Neptune
- Dwarf Planets
  - Sirius & Pluto
- Planet comes from word that meant wanderer
  - Planets wander
  - #definition Prograde planets move eastward along the zodiac
  - #definition Planets in retrograde appear to move westward
- Anything that didn't have a place in the sky where it sat was considered an ancient planet.
  - Ancient Planets:
    - Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Saturn & Jupiter
    - We were on earth so they didn't know
    - Couldn't see Neptune
    - Uranus was known but it moved so slowly they didn't realize it was a planet they thought it was a star
- 7 Ancient Planets give us the 7 day week
  - Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus in Latin
  - Tuesday is Mardi in French and so on in romance languages
  - They all correlated to Germanic Pagan Gods

**Months**

- Comes from the moon
  - 12 men walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972
  - Moon is nearest neighbour
  - The moon's orbital period is 27.3 days (Sidereal Month)
    - Perigee - Closest to Earth
    - Apogee - Farthest from earth
  - The moon does not glow!
  - The lunar phase cycle repeats every 29.5 days (Synonic month)
    - growing = waxing _bright on the right_
    - shrinking = waning
  - Southern hemisphere waxing other direction
  - "Moon'ths" are based on lunar phase cycles
  - First quarter, half time, thirdquarter is how it is split
  - Gibbous is when they are mostly bright but not totally

#### Class Questions

1. When a planet is in retrograde, where would you look to see it rise in the sky?

   1. Still rises in the east and sets in the west because of how fast the earth's rotation is.

   **Lunar Eclipses**

- Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes through Earth's shadow.
  - They can only occur during a full moon when the Sun and moon are at opposition
  - Penumbra: Wimpy Part of shadow
  - Umbra: Thick part of shadow
- Why are total lunar eclipses red?
  - Earth's atmosphere refracts and scatters sunlight.
  - Bent in when it hits us, bent out when it exists
- Partial Lunar Eclipse
  - At maximum eclipse, only part of the moon is blocked by Earth's umbral shadow
- Penumbral lunar clipse
  - Moves into wimpy shadow but never gets a chunk taken out of it
  - Here 89% of the moon is in Earth's penumbral shadow.

**Solar Eclipses**

- Only occur during new moons when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction.
- Solar eclipses seen from Earth are unique.
  - Observing a solar eclipse is rare.
  - Moon's shadow + Earth's rotation = _short eclipse_ seen by few!
  - Moon is so much smaller than earth making them a lot harder to see, the shadow is super small and you'll only see it for a few minutes
- Different Types
  - Partial
    - A partial eclipse is seen by people in the Moon's penumbral shadow
  - Total Solar Eclipse
    - The sun's corona can be seen during totality
    - A total eclipse is seen by people in the Moon's tiny umbral shadow.
    - It occurs near perigee.
    - All sunlight is blocked
  - Annular Solar Eclipse
    - Occurs near apogee
    - Seen by people in the Moon's antumbral shadow
      - (Some sunlight still coming around)
  - Hybrid eclipses are super rare
    - Some people will see total solar eclipse, while some see it as an annular eclipse.
- Eclipse Seasons occur at roughly six month intervals
  - Why don't we see an eclipse at every new or full moon?
    - The moon's orbit is inclined by 5°
    - #definition Syzgy occurs when the earth, moon, and sun are aligned

**Telescopes**

- Refractors vs Reflectors
  - Refactors use lenses to gather and focus incoming light, whereas reflectors use mirrors for that purpuse
  - Refracting Telescopes
    - Disadvantages:
      - Long
      - Top Heavy
      - Little support for primary lens
      - Two-sided lens
    - Yerkes Observatory has the largest at 1-meter diameter.
  - Reflecting Telescipes
    - Vera C. Rubin Observatory
      - 8.4m x 6.4m
    - They melt glass down and then they spin the kiln around for days to get it into the right shape
    - Mirror blanks need not be solid
    - Honeycomb mirrors exist now
    - Disadvantage:
      - Reflecting telescopes create diffraction spikes, so the camera is going to be blocking primary mirror, when light enters telescope and has to bend around support structure it leaves the diffraction (Light bending around an obstruction)

**Angular Resolution**

- Normally we use computer screens for resolution, more pixels = better resolution
- Resolution is space is not pixels or size
- #definition Angular Resolution: One measure is angular seperation at which two point sources become indistringuishable from each other.
- #definition Diffraction Limit how much does every point of light get blurred
  - A = wavelength
- What gives a telescope better resolution
  - Resolution scales w/ diamater, 100x bigger diamater = 100x better resolution
  - Wave length of light, poor image the further apart they are
- 10x bigger dish = 10^2x better picture in Light Collecting/Gathering Power
- Diffraction limit = Angular Resolution
- #definition Interferometry: A bunch of telescopes take the whole image, but you interphere the light from different perspectives to get better resolution

#### Class Questions

1. Weather forecasts generally represent daytime with the sun and nighttime with the moon, is this scientifically accurate?
   1. Yes & No, no because you can see the moon at all times of day, yes because sun is only out during day generally
2. What type of eclipse would be seen by astronauts living on the near side of the moon in the diagram below?
   1. Partial
3. Why do we use telescopes to study the sky?
   1. See things you can't see with your eyes
   2. Fainter things
   3. See further
   4. Observe during the day
   5. Observe other rays
4. Which telescope has better angular resolution
   1. Hubble Space Telescope (diffraction limit: 0.05") **Better**
   2. Very Large Array (diffraction limit: 1.5")
5. Why don't professional astronomers care about magnification?
   1. Resolution is what it is, blowing up a blurry picture doesn't make it any better
   2. You can only pick up so much light.
6. True or False? Astronauts are weightless in space because there is no gravity there.
   1. Yes, you don't weigh anything, but you still have mass.
